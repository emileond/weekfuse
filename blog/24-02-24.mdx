When your emails bounce, failing to reach your recipient isn’t the only negative consequence. Every bounce signals to email service providers that you aren’t properly managing your mailing list, which **can hurt your sender reputation and deliverability rates**.

This means you should do everything you can to avoid bounces. Luckily, there are some fairly simple solutions. Here are the top three reasons why emails bounce and how to prevent it:

## 1. Invalid Email Addresses

If you send an email to an address that doesn’t exist, it will bounce. This often happens when:

- The email address has a typo (e.g., john.doe@gmial.com instead of gmail.com).
- The recipient changed their email address or left their company.
- Someone signed up with a fake or disposable email.

### How to Prevent It

- Use an email verification tool like [MailerFuse](https://mailerfuse.com) to validate addresses before sending.
- Regularly clean your mailing list to remove inactive or incorrect addresses.
- Implement double opt-in to ensure subscribers provide a valid email address.

## 2. Poor Sender Reputation

Your sender reputation determines whether email providers trust you or send your messages straight to spam (or bounce them entirely). Several factors impact sender reputation, including:

- High bounce rates
- Low engagement (few opens and replies)
- Spam complaints
- Sending from a shared IP with spammer reputation

### How to Improve It

- Avoid purchased or outdated email lists.
- Use an email verifier to reduce bounce rates before sending campaigns.
- Monitor your domain’s reputation with tools like Google Postmaster Tools.

## 3. Recipient Server Issues

Sometimes, even valid emails bounce due to temporary issues on the recipient’s mail server, such as:

- The recipient’s inbox is full (soft bounce).
- Their server is temporarily down.
- They have strict spam filters blocking your domain.

### How to Handle It

- For soft bounces, retry sending after some time.
- Check if your emails are landing in spam and adjust your content accordingly.
- Authenticate your emails with SPF, DKIM, and DMARC to improve deliverability.

## Final Thoughts
You should aim for a bounce rate lower than 2%. MailerFuse helps you filter out invalid addresses before hitting send, improving your bounce rate instantly.
